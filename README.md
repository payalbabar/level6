## Getting Started 🏁

### 🌟 Project Demo & Links
- **Live Demo**: [https://lpg-connect-wallet.vercel.app/](https://lpg-connect-wallet.vercel.app/)
- **Demo Video**: [https://youtu.be/xtzdsvQu-Ew](https://youtu.be/xtzdsvQu-Ew)

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run Development Server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Configure Environment**:
   Create a `.env` file with your Base44 App ID:
   ```env
   VITE_BASE44_APP_ID=your_app_id
   VITE_BASE44_APP_BASE_URL=https://your-app.base44.app
   ```

## Design System 🎨

The app uses a modern "Glassmorphism" aesthetic with a dark sidebar and a clean, vibrant content area. It prioritizes readability and "Blockchain" feel using JetBrains Mono for hashes and IDs.

## User Validation & Feedback 📊

As part of validating our MVP, we collected feedback from real testnet users via [this Google Form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeEEkw9WKm8rf73X4fk0EcvWSQWT8G3TvID-9w_82UFZOEj2w/viewform?usp=publish-editor).

### 👥 Testnet User Validations
To validate our real-world MVP, we tested the platform with 5+ real testnet users using Freighter wallets. Here are their verified Stellar wallet addresses:
1. `GCCKKVQS54JRCSTB64AQEQTMNVQBJ7JDDTP7US7ESBXIAQPMNL3P23F5`
2. `GDUFDJ23MIR2KR6FC3VTKA7YTCLJAJY5GL2UIX35HCFCZUPJCW7ZT6K5`
3. `GBKMNSFTMO5ZLC3TATXXFRC4QUOKD6ERTDWHQCXVB62KSELKG6QAWUJJ`
4. `GCHB2KGFMWFAM7HOQYUFNPQXAQMAY6U7OLXAP4BEJWIJWXBV6IDKB7DR`
5. `GDBIJBJQKTW3QCTAYL6KFNS2HHNSI3G7BI4AYORHAUIM5MZGOXQKULGN`

### MVP Iteration & Future Improvements 🛠️

Based on the initial user feedback, we've planned and started implementing key improvements. Here is our first completed iteration directly requested by users:

**Iteration 1: Wallet Connection UX Improvement**
*Feedback*: Users felt anxious during the wallet connection phase because there was no visual feedback that a background request was happening.
*Improvement*: Added dynamic loading states and spinners to the "Connect Wallet" button on the Landing Page.
- **[View Git Commit for this Iteration](https://github.com/payalbabar/lpg_connectWallet/commit/a4bf2c1db2a343d22c584a5527aef92f2041f60e)**


**Future Roadmap Based on User Feedback:**
- **Enhanced Payment Tracking**: Users want to see XLM transaction links directly in the dashboard after booking.
- **Onboarding Tooltips**: 2 users suggested that first-time onboarding for Freighter wallet should have a guided "How to Connect" modal.
